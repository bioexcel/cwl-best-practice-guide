# Writing incremental tests

## Find/create test data for each step. 

If the data is open then partial data from earlier steps is easiest to use.

Intermediate data for a workflow can be generated by calling the CWL reference implementation `cwl-runner` with the `--cachedir` option. This will cache all step outputs, which you can then copy to create test data for distribution.

## Structure workflow files to support testing

CWL workflows can be nested. When writing a complex workflow it can be better to creak this into several scripts, so that each can be tested independently.

## Setting up automated testing with GitHub Actions

## Defensive CWL programming

Using guards for inputs and outputs
