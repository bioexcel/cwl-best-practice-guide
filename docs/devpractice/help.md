# Asking for help

The principle forum for CWL related news and discussion is <https://cwl.discourse.group/>. This is both an announcement and discussion list for CWL, and is used by the CWL developers (so you are more likely to get a helpful response here). You can also, as for most programming languages, use <https://stackoverflow.com/>; responses here will be slower, but checking here for previous questions will be useful.

Before asking for help it is good practice to search the forums for similar questions first, to see if a solution has already been suggested, and also to see if you can add to any discussion which may already exist for that issue. When asking about error messages, or development problems, it is useful to have a minimum working example of your workflow that shows / demonstrates the problem. Doing this will enable others to see if they can replicate your issue, and suggest possible solutions.
