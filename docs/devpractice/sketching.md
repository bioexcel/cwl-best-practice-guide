# Sketching out workflow

## Is there a baseline to start from?
Based on existing shell scripts or workflow in other language?
..or published best-practice pipeline (e.g. GATK4)?

Do any similar open source workflows exists (even in another language)?

## What will be the inputs and outputs data and formats? 

What are their storage/access requirements?

# What are the execution restrictions?
Can it run on the public cloud? Is data confidential? Cost/time limits?
Can workflow be developed in open?

# Making a valid non-executable workflow
Using abstract operations as placeholders
