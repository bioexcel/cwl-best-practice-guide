# Finding / creating tools


## Locate existing CWL-described tools

<https://github.com/common-workflow-library> and <https://dockstore.org/>

### versioning of CWL tool descriptions 

using `git submodules`


## Finding existing packages in BioConda/BioContainers

Check <https://bioconda.github.io/ and <https://biocontainers.pro/> for suitable packages

## Find existing container images

at <https://hub.docker.com/> and <https://quay.io/> (includes BioContainer) - check origin, and if itâ€™s up to date

## Check license requirements of tools

 - are they suitable for your use?

## Did someone already write a CWL description?

Check global GitHub search for Common Workflow Language files as last resort

## Using git submodules

Using `biobb_adapters` as example in <https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb-wf-md-setup-protein-cwl>
