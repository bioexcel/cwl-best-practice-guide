# Writing incremental tests

Providing tests for workflows is important - they enable new users to be sure that a workflow behaves as expected, and also gives developers a reference to use to ensure that any changes made to the tools doesn't break the workflow. Setting up tests can be daunting, and time consuming at the start, but doing so will pay off in the long term. Below we discuss some of the details of how to do this.

## Find/create test data for each step

If the data is open then partial data from earlier steps is easiest to use.

Intermediate data for a workflow can be generated by calling the CWL reference implementation `cwl-runner` with the `--cachedir` option. This will cache all step outputs, which you can then copy to create test data for distribution. A perhaps more tedious alternative is to add workflow level `outputs` mapped from every step's outputs and copy test data manually.

The `--cachedir` option, sometimes combined with `--target` is also useful for incremental testing of a workflow, as it will reuse old outputs as long as a tool configuration and tool inputs match exactly a previous execution.Note that this means the step outputs are assumed to be reusable - for tools with mutable state (e.g. `wget` of current weather or a database lookup) add the [WorkReuse](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/CommandLineTool.html#WorkReuse) hint with `enableReuse: false` to force re-execution.

## Structure workflow files to support testing

CWL workflows can be [nested](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/22-nested-workflows/index.html). When writing a complex workflow it can be better to break this into several scripts, so that each can be tested independently.

This also allows you to make siblings of the parent workflow to tweak data handling, while retaining most of the reusable steps inside the nested workflows.


## Setting up automated testing with GitHub Actions

If you are using github to host your git repository, then you can make use of github actions to automate your testing process. Setting the tests up can be a (relatively) straightforward process, if you follow a few simple rules, and approach this in an iterative manner.

The minimum requirements are:
- github actions script
- package dependency file for your script

Your dependency file will describe the packages needed to run CWL (in the first instance - you can add other dependencies later). If you use conda for installing the `cwl_runner` then this could be as simple as:
```
name: cwlrunner
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - cwl_runner
```
This should be saved in your git repository - in this example the file will be called `env.yml`.

The github actions script should be saved in a folder `.github/workflows/` within your git repository. The basic layout this takes is:
```
name: CI testing

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:

  workflow_validation:
  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        submodules: recursive
    
    - name: Set up Conda
      uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
      with:
        auto-update-conda: true
        python-version: 3.8
        activate-environment: cwlrunner
        environment-file: env.yml
     
     - name: Validate Script
       run: |
         conda run -n cwlrunner cwltool --validate script.cwl
```
